# Student Habits and Performance Visualization Requirements

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the visualization requirements for analyzing the relationship between student habits, characteristics, and academic performance. The dataset contains information about 1000+ students, including their study habits, lifestyle choices, and exam scores.

## 2. Key Metrics and Variables

### Primary Target Variable

- `exam_score` (Continuous, 0-100)

### Key Independent Variables

1. Academic Habits:

   - `study_hours_per_day` (Continuous, 0-24)
   - `attendance_percentage` (Continuous, 0-100)

2. Digital Habits:

   - `social_media_hours` (Continuous)
   - `netflix_hours` (Continuous)
   - `internet_quality` (Categorical: Poor, Average, Good)

3. Lifestyle Factors:

   - `sleep_hours` (Continuous)
   - `exercise_frequency` (Continuous, 0-7)
   - `diet_quality` (Categorical: Poor, Fair, Good)
   - `part_time_job` (Binary: Yes/No)

4. Demographics:
   - `age` (Continuous)
   - `gender` (Categorical: Male, Female, Other)
   - `parental_education_level` (Categorical)

## 3. Required Visualizations

     - `exam_score`
   - Features:
     - Trend lines
     - Color coding by performance quartiles
     - Correlation coefficients

### 3.3. Digital Life Balance

3. **Screen Time vs. Performance**
   - Type: Bubble chart
   - Variables:
     - X-axis: `social_media_hours`
     - Y-axis: `netflix_hours`
     - Bubble size: `exam_score`
     - Color: `internet_quality`
   - Purpose: Visualize the relationship between digital habits and academic performance

### 3.4. Lifestyle Patterns

4. **Wellness Factor Analysis**
   - Type: Parallel coordinates plot
   - Variables:
     - `sleep_hours`
     - `exercise_frequency`
     - `diet_quality`
     - `exam_score`
   - Features:
     - Interactive brushing
     - Color coding by performance levels

### 3.5. Demographic Insights

5. **Performance by Demographics**
   - Type: Box plots
   - Multiple views:
     - By gender
     - By parental education level
     - By age groups (binned)
   - Features:
     - Median lines
     - Outlier points
     - Statistical annotations

### 3.6. Work-Life Balance

6. **Part-time Job Impact**
   - Type: Violin plots
   - Split by: `part_time_job` status
   - Y-axis: `exam_score`
   - Features:
     - Median lines
     - Quartile markers
     - Kernel density estimation

## 4. Interactive Features

- Filtering capabilities for all visualizations
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Ability to zoom and pan where applicable
- Dynamic updating of related visualizations
- Export functionality for generated charts

## 5. Visual Style Guidelines

- Consistent color scheme throughout
- Clear, readable fonts
- Proper aspect ratios for each chart type
- Meaningful titles and axis labels
- Legend placement that doesn't interfere with data
- Appropriate use of whitespace

## 6. Technical Requirements

- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Efficient rendering for large datasets
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility considerations (color blindness, etc.)
- Data preprocessing capabilities

## 7. Optional Enhancements

- Time-based analysis if temporal data is added later
- Statistical significance indicators
- Trend line overlays
- Custom aggregation options
- Advanced filtering mechanisms

## 8. Implementation Notes

### Data Preprocessing Steps

1. Handle missing values if any
2. Convert categorical variables to appropriate formats
3. Scale numerical variables where necessary
4. Create derived features (e.g., performance quartiles)
5. Validate data ranges and constraints

### Visualization Libraries

- Primary: Plotly.js for interactive visualizations
- Secondary: D3.js for custom visualizations
- Supporting: NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation

### Color Scheme

- Primary colors:
  - Main theme: #2C3E50 (Dark Blue)
  - Accent: #E74C3C (Red)
  - Highlight: #3498DB (Light Blue)
- Use ColorBrewer schemes for categorical variables
- Ensure all colors are accessible

This visualization plan will provide a comprehensive view of the factors affecting student performance while maintaining clarity and usability. Each visualization is chosen to best represent the relationships between variables and support data-driven insights about student habits and academic success.
